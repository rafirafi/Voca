## 
A simple app I use to take simple key/value notes so I can review them with Anki later.
## Features
Import/Export from/to tab separated csv.  
Export to apkg (needs KArchive)  
French translation.  
Remember current deck and ui options(ui zoom...).  
One opened/current deck, many decks in database.  
Completion from current deck when entering a word.  
## TODO (eventually):
allow to explore/modify deck in table view p.ex.  
allow to remove note  
display notes cnt by deck in deck chooser  
allow to export note based on creation date ( add timestamp field)
